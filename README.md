# Boku Game 🎲

Hey there! Welcome to the world of **Boku**. It's a super cool strategic game played on a quirky 10x10 hexagonal matrix. Your mission? Line up five of your pieces in a row while trying to pull off some sneaky capture moves. Think you've got what it takes? 🚀

## Let's Break Down the Rules 📜:

### The Board 🛠:
- So, imagine a 10x10 matrix with each little cell having its own coordinate.
- With our unique hexagonal design:
  - Corner cells (vertexes of the hexagon) have only 3 buddies next to them.
  - Edge cells? They chill with 4 neighbors.
  - All the others in the middle? They're the life of the party with 6 neighbors!

### Your Mission 🎯:
- Simple but challenging: line up five of your pieces in any of the six directions. Sounds easy, right? 😉

### Making Moves 🕺:
- Take turns and drop one of your pieces on an empty spot.
- Spotted a capture move? Go for it! But remember, it's a must-do!
- When you pull off a "capture" move and sandwich two of your opponent's pieces, you get to kick one out.
  - But be careful, the spot you just cleared? Off-limits for the next move!

### Quick Checks Before You Leap 🚦:
- Here's what you need to remember before you drop your piece:
  - Is the spot free? Go for it!
  - Was a piece just kicked out from there? Maybe next turn!
  - Oh, and make sure it's your turn, especially after a capture move because you get an extra move to remove an opponent's piece. Sweet!

### Some Extra Stuff You Should Know 🤓:
1. **One at a Time**: Even if you see multiple captures, you can only pick one piece to kick out. Choose wisely!
2. **Stalemate?**: If the board's all filled up and no one's won yet, it's a draw. 🤷‍♂️
3. **Pass It On**: No moves left? Hand the turn over to your opponent.
4. **Déjà vu?**: If the board looks exactly the same three times, call it a draw. It's rare, but hey, it happens!
